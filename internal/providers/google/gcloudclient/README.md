# Google Cloud Go Client from Google Cloud SDK

Some of the functions are implemented in Cloud Client Libraries for Go. We are implementing them in gcloudclient package until google cloud client libraries support them.
Once they are supported, we will remove the implementation from gcloudclient package and use the Cloud Client Libraries for Go.
